    <p>
        A good number of projects now have expressly-written
        Codes of Conduct,
        which are community-agreed-upon terms of engagement
        to minimize harrassing and trolling on those platforms.
        The <em>{{ title }}</em> webring,
        being not in control, really, of its members' conduct,
        instead has a code of <em>content</em>
        that dictates what is and is not acceptable on members' pages.
    </p>
    <p>
        Members of this webring agree to follow this code of content
        to enable everyone to have a safe and fun webring.
        No one should have to link to any content that makes them feel
        unsafe or <em>less-than</em>.
        That is the purpose of this code of content.
    </p>

<section id="acceptable-content" class="container">
    <header><a href="#acceptable-content"><h1>Acceptable content</h1></a></header>
    <p>
        Any content is acceptable that is not unacceptable.
        Really &mdash; diverse people are important for diverse thinking,
        and diverse thinking is important for strong communities.
        We're excited to read it all!
    </p>

<section id="unacceptable-content" class="container">
    <header><a href="#unacceptable-content"><h1>Unacceptable content</h1></a></header>
    <p>
        Content that is
        racist,
        homophobic,
        transphobic,
        xenophobic,
        or
        misogynistic;
        or that disparages any person or group based on their
        gender,
        gender identity and expression,
        sexual orientation,
        disability,
        physical appearance,
        race,
        religion,
        or other protected statuses;
        or that is used to harass other members of this webring
        is unacceptable.
