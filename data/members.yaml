      Hub for the Cloudy Cuckoo Cosmos, a series of novels and stories in
      a fantasy/science-fiction setting without humans! Except for one. He
      runs the site. Cloudy with a chance of nonsense.

      <p>A queer eye in your sci-fi
      <p>I write arcanepunk and space opera. I love the intersection of history,
      fantasy, science and mystery, and am only really happy when at least two
      leaves of that venn diagram overlap.
